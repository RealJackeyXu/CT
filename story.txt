An ancient temple was built on top of that mountain. An old monk and a young monk lived in this temple. The old monk, who was supposed to tell a story to the young monk, was finally bored of telling this infinitely long story and remained silent. Many years after, the young monk grew, and the old monk was too old to continue his self-cultivation. He realized that this would be the end of his story. He passed away from his old heavy body, and with enough kind deeds done in his life, he reached Nirvana, the afterlife heaven. From there he saw worlds and worlds, along the irreversible infinity of time, chained and convoluted. The temple was always built on that mountain, and the story was always told. Who is telling the story now? He wondered.

It was the once young monk. He began to age as he continued to tell the story. He told the story to another monk in the ancient temple on top of the mountain. He described the same story over and over again. When it was time for him to pass on his role as the narrator to the younger monk, the younger monk was nowhere to be found. He disappeared into the fog. The story remained in the high mountains where there was an ancient temple.
