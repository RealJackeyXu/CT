An ancient temple was built on top of that mountain. An old monk and a young monk lived in this temple. The old monk, who was supposed to tell a story to the young monk, was finally bored of telling this infinitely long story and remained silent. Many years after, the young monk grew, and the old monk was too old to continue his self-cultivation. He realized that this would be the end of his story. He passed away from his old heavy body, and with enough kind deeds done in his life, he reached Nirvana, the afterlife heaven. From there he saw worlds and worlds, along the irreversible infinity of time, chained and convoluted. The temple was always built on that mountain, and the story was always told. Who is telling the story now? He wondered.
